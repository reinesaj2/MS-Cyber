\title{Peer Review of "Sin 1: SQL Injection" PowerPoint}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Main Ideas }
The PowerPoint focus on SQL injection vulnerabilites, explaining how attacker can manipulate SQL querys to gains unauthorized access databases. It provide a comprehensive overview of SQL basic, types of SQL injection (e.g., In-band, Blind, Out-of-band), and mitigation strategy such as use of prepared statement and input validation. The real-world example of Tesla and Fortnite demonstrates consequences of these vulnerabilities, making content more relateable.

\section{Discussion Forum}
The discussion forum cover key aspect of SQL injection prevention. Major points how SQL injection vulnerabilities arise from poor coding practice, particularly when user input not properly validated. The forum also explored best practices for secure databases, such as enforce least privilege and regularly update systems. Input validation and use of ORM framework were among most discussed strategy.

\section{Presentation Slides}
\subsection{Improvement over 2023 Slides}
There has been noticeable improvement over previous versions of presentation. The 2024 slides offers more in-depth explanation of different type of SQL injections and include additional real-world case study. The updated example and added contents on mitigation technique make presentation more relevant and informatives.

\subsection{Flow}
The flow of informations is logical and easy to follow. It begin with basic introduction to SQL, then move to more complex topics such types of SQL injections, their consequences, and finally how to prevent thems. The progression is smooth and use of example reinforce the learning point.

\subsection{Coverage }
The topic is covered thorough. All essential aspect of SQL injection are discussed, including both common types (e.g., Union-based, Error-based) and more complex techniques (e.g., Blind, Out-of-band). The mitigation strategy are well-explained, though some could benefits from more concrete example of how to implement them in code.

\section{Discussion Forum  }
The presenter post an adequate number of question and comments. They addressed key issue related to SQL injection vulnerabilities and best practice for prevention. The chosen question cover main area of concern, such as input validation, use of prepared statements, and real-world consequences of SQL injection attacks. However, some questions could have delved deeper into advanced mitigation technique.

The presenter was actively engage in forum discussions. They respond thoughtfully to comments and provide further explanations when needed. The interaction encouraged deeper discussion, especially around real-world example of SQL injection and how to apply mitigation technique in practice.

\section{Overall Evaluation and Suggestions for Improvement}
The PowerPoint presentation is well-organized and informative, making good use of real-world example to explain importance of SQL injection prevention. The forum discussion was also active, with relevant question and response that enriched learning experience. To further improve presentation, I recommend adding more code example to mitigation section and incorporating more visuals to break down complex concept like Blind SQL injection.
